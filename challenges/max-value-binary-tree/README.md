# Find the maximum value in a Binary Tree
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Use a traversal to search a Binary Tree


## Problem
<!-- Embedded whiteboard image -->
Write a function called find-maximum-value which takes binary tree as its only input. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the maximum value stored in the tree. You can assume that the values stored in the Binary Tree will be numeric.

## Solution
Binary tree with the values 3, 5, 8, 120, 44, 1, 100 returns the value of 120
