#### Checklist (before submitting, fill in each set of square brackets with an 'x')
- [] Create a Class for a Node which is aware of the value as val and next as _next
<br>- []Ensure that you have a __str__ method defined to return the value of the node when printed
<br>
<br>


- [] Create a Class for a LinkedList which creates an empty Linked List when instantiated.
<br>
- [] This class should be aware of a default None value assigned to head when the list is created.
- [] This class should be aware of the len of the list, which represents the count of Nodes in the list at any time
- [] This class should have the ability to accept an iterable as an argument when instantiated, such as [1, 2, 3, 4], and creates a new Node in the list for each value in the iterable.
- [] Define any further magic methods such as len and str to support user functionality and informative responses.
- [] Define a method called insert which takes any value as an argument and adds that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.
- [] Define a method called find which takes any value as an argument and returns True or False depending on whether that value exists as a Node value within the list.
